# Paradox Primitive

**Verifiable Proof of Work on Nostr** — a minimal three-kind protocol 
for requesting tasks, proving completion, and settling instantly in Bitcoin.

`Kind 1069` → Task Request  
`Kind 1070` → Completion Claim (with proofs)  
`Kind 1071` → Verification & Acceptance (triggers zap payment)

No middlemen. Humans & AI on open permissionless rails.
